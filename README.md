### Purpose

The script emulates a EV charger in Venus OS. It gets the MQTT data from a subscribed topic and publishes the information on the dbus as the service `com.victronenergy.evcharger.mqtt_ev_charger` with the VRM instance `11`.


### Config

Copy or rename the `config.sample.ini` to `config.ini` in the `dbus-mqtt-ev-charger` folder and change it as you need it.

# Read settings

Changed settings can be found on this MQTT path of the Venus OS broker:

```
N/<vrm_id>/evcharger/11/...
```


### Install / Update

1. Login to your Venus OS device via SSH. See [Venus OS:Root Access](https://www.victronenergy.com/live/ccgx:root_access#root_access) for more details.

2. Execute this commands to download and extract the files:

    ```bash
    # change to temp folder
    cd /tmp

    # download driver
    wget -O /tmp/venus-os_dbus-mqtt-ev-charger.zip https://github.com/mr-manuel/venus-os_dbus-mqtt-ev-charger/archive/refs/heads/master.zip

    # If updating: cleanup old folder
    rm -rf /tmp/venus-os_dbus-mqtt-ev-charger-master

    # unzip folder
    unzip venus-os_dbus-mqtt-ev-charger.zip

    # If updating: backup existing config file
    mv /data/etc/dbus-mqtt-ev-charger/config.ini /data/etc/dbus-mqtt-ev-charger_config.ini

    # If updating: cleanup existing driver
    rm -rf /data/etc/dbus-mqtt-ev-charger

    # copy files
    cp -R /tmp/venus-os_dbus-mqtt-ev-charger-master/dbus-mqtt-ev-charger/ /data/etc/

    # If updating: restore existing config file
    mv /data/etc/dbus-mqtt-ev-charger_config.ini /data/etc/dbus-mqtt-ev-charger/config.ini
    ```

3. Copy the sample config file, if you are installing the driver for the first time and edit it to your needs.

    ```bash
    # copy default config file
    cp /data/etc/dbus-mqtt-ev-charger/config.sample.ini /data/etc/dbus-mqtt-ev-charger/config.ini

    # edit the config file with nano
    nano /data/etc/dbus-mqtt-ev-charger/config.ini
    ```

4. Run `bash /data/etc/dbus-mqtt-ev-charger/install.sh` to install the driver as service.

   The daemon-tools should start this service automatically within seconds.


### Uninstall

Run `/data/etc/dbus-mqtt-ev-charger/uninstall.sh`


### Restart

Run `/data/etc/dbus-mqtt-ev-charger/restart.sh`


### Debugging

The logs can be checked with `tail -n 100 -F /data/log/dbus-mqtt-ev-charger/current | tai64nlocal`

The service status can be checked with svstat `svstat /service/dbus-mqtt-ev-charger`

This will output somethink like `/service/dbus-mqtt-ev-charger: up (pid 5845) 185 seconds`

If the seconds are under 5 then the service crashes and gets restarted all the time. If you do not see anything in the logs you can increase the log level in `/data/etc/dbus-mqtt-ev-charger/dbus-mqtt-ev-charger.py` by changing `level=logging.WARNING` to `level=logging.INFO` or `level=logging.DEBUG`

If the script stops with the message `dbus.exceptions.NameExistsException: Bus name already exists: com.victronenergy.evcharger.mqtt_ev_charger"` it means that the service is still running or another service is using that bus name.


### Multiple instances

It's possible to have multiple instances, but it's not automated. Follow these steps to achieve this:

1. Save the new name to a variable `driverclone=dbus-mqtt-ev-charger-2`

2. Copy current folder `cp -r /data/etc/dbus-mqtt-ev-charger/ /data/etc/$driverclone/`

3. Rename the main script `mv /data/etc/$driverclone/dbus-mqtt-ev-charger.py /data/etc/$driverclone/$driverclone.py`

4. Fix the script references for service and log
    ```
    sed -i 's:dbus-mqtt-ev-charger:'$driverclone':g' /data/etc/$driverclone/service/run
    sed -i 's:dbus-mqtt-ev-charger:'$driverclone':g' /data/etc/$driverclone/service/log/run
    ```

5. Change the `device_name`, increase the `device_instance` and update the `topic` in the `config.ini`

Now you can install and run the cloned driver. Should you need another instance just increase the number in step 1 and repeat all steps.


### Compatibility

It was tested on following devices:

* RaspberryPi 4b
* MultiPlus II (GX Version)
